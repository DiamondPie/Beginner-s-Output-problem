# Beginner-s-Output-problem
## Create a Mad-Lib:

> What are Mad-Libs?
> 
> You are given a prompt (e.g. Enter a name) and the user themselves must fill this in.
> 
> There will be multiple prompts given for multiple different objects (e.g. colour, verb) and the user must also input the corresponding values (e.g. if the prompt is ‘Enter a number’ do not put ‘Apple’)
> 
> After these prompts are given, add them all into one string to output (print). 

Essentially, your code should be able to output this. The input is in italic: 

Welcome to Mad Libs!

What is your name? _Julia_

Enter an adjective (describing word): _cool_

Enter a verb: _cook_

Enter a place: _home_

Enter a food: _cake_

Enter a vehicle: _car_

## Output 

_Julia_ is a very _cool_ person to be around. They love to _cook_ in _home_. Their favourite food is _cake_ which they eat in a _car_. 

> Note that the _italic_ words are actually your variables. Your sentence is supposed to not make sense as well! (Note the bad grammar).
